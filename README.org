#+title: Gabriel's Dotfiles

Enjoy!

Dotfiles themselves (that live in .config or my home dir) are generated from
=Dots.org=. This includes things like zsh, emacs, and wezterm. I use =stow=
to link these in my home directory.

System configuration (NixOS specifically) comes from =Systems.org=. So far
only my desktop lives there, since I have yet to install things elsewhere.
