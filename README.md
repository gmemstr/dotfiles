Dotfiles
===

As per tradition, this is a repository of my personal configuration/dotfiles.
My setup currently consists of:

* zsh & [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) as a shell
* Wayland for desktop compositing
* [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) for window management
* [Wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi) for app launching
* [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) for status bar
* [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) terminal
* [Swaylock](https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock) for locking the machine
* [Kanshi](https://github.com/emersion/kanshi) for managing monitor 
configuraton
* [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for properly linking dotfiles

This repository isn't a "catch all" yet, as I copy over and wrangle various
configuration files.
